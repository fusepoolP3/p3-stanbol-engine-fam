eu.fusepool.enhancer.engines.fise2fam.Fise2FamEngine.name=Apache Stanbol Enhancer Engine: FISE to FAM transformation
eu.fusepool.enhancer.engines.fise2fam.Fise2FamEngine.description=Post-processing engine that converts the Stanbol \
Enhancement Structure (FISE) to the Fusepool Annotation Model (FAM).

enhancer.engine.fise2fam.selectortype.name=Selector Type
enhancer.engine.fise2fam.selectortype.description=This allows to specify the type of the Selector. \
Supported values are `NIF` (NIF 2.0 selector), `OA` (Open Annotation) and `BOTH` (compatibility \
mode that write both NIF and OA selectors). The default is `NIF`.

enhancer.engine.fise2fam.selectortype.option.nif=NIF 2.0 selector
enhancer.engine.fise2fam.selectortype.option.oa=Open Annotation selector
enhancer.engine.fise2fam.selectortype.option.both=NIF and OA selectors (compatibility mode)

enhancer.engine.fise2fam.metadata.name=Write Metadata
enhancer.engine.fise2fam.metadata.description=If disabled no `oa:Annotation` and \
`oa:SpecificResource` instances are serialized. This makes the resulting RDF incompatible with \
Open Annotation (and therefore OA based clients). However it also greatly reduces the triple count \
(>> 50%) and might therefore be an option in usage cases optimized for the Fusepool Annotation Model.
